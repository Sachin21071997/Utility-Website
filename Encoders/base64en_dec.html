    <h2>Base64 encoding</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Base64 encoding</b> schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data, especially when that data needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with text.<br>
        This encoding helps to ensure that the data remains intact without modification during transport.
    <p>
        <b>Base64 encoding</b> is used commonly in a number of applications including email via MIME, as well as storing complex data in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction">XML</a> or <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON.</a>
